Bridging the Digital Divide - Offline Payment System for Rural India - HackOn With Amazon - Season 5

Problem - 67% of rural India is not well connected to the internet, resulting in Amazon losing ₹1,200+ crores of orders every year due to non-delivery and restricting 400+ million people from being potential customers. Conventional payment mechanisms entirely collapse in the absence of internet connectivity, making rural consumers incapable of concluding e-commerce transactions even when they possess cash in hand.

Customer Pain Points -
Payment apps become useless without internet access
Compulsory dependence on risky cash-on-delivery (COD) models
Orders are often cancelled because of failed payments at the time of network failure
Inability to make purchases at night shifts or monsoon seasons when connectivity is weakest
Long delay in order confirmations

Amazon's Business Impact -
₹1,200 crore annual revenue loss due to failed COD deliveries
40% more return rates in rural markets compared to urban markets
Heavy logistics overhead for cash handling operations
Limited market penetration - lacks access to 400M potential users
Seasonal revenue declines during monsoons and network blackout times

Innovation Scope -
Amazon Seva Pay turns the connectivity issue into a community-driven solution by building India's first human-infrastructure payment network that doesn't rely on internet connectivity and yet harmoniously connects with Amazon's current ecosystem.
